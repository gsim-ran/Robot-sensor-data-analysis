# Robot-sensor-data-analysis
The given Python code illustrates a hypothetical situation in which a robot detects and avoids obstacles using distance sensor data.  By removing inaccurate values from raw sensor inputs and comparing them to a predetermined safety threshold, it detects obstructions.  The application highlights locations where impediments are detected in a line plot that displays the sensor data.  Based on obstacle detection, it then mimics the robot's movements, such as stopping or rerouting.  This method simulates how robots can use sensor data analysis to make judgments in real time while interacting with their surroundings.
